TMHT Data Search Project Overview
==================================

Project Purpose:
----------------
A web application for managing and searching teen attendance and student information at The Maker's House Teens Church. It is a single-page app using HTML, CSS (custom + Tailwind), JavaScript, and Supabase as the backend database.

Key Features:
-------------
- Real-time search for student records by name
- Add/Edit/Delete student records via modal form
- Inline editing of fields in result cards
- Attendance tracking for four specific dates
- Statistics dashboard (total, gender, level breakdown)
- CSV export of all data
- Theme switcher (green, purple, blue, admin)
- Dark mode toggle
- Admin mode (password-protected features)

File Structure:
---------------
- index.html: Main HTML file, UI and modals
- style.css: Custom styles
- adminStyles.css: Admin modal/theme styles
- app.js: Main JS logic (UI, data, stats)
- admin.js: Admin-only section logic
- adminAuth.js: Admin authentication logic
- csvExport.js: CSV export logic
- site.webmanifest: PWA manifest
- README.md: Documentation

Supabase Integration:
---------------------
- Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (Postgres DB, Auth, RESTful APIs)
- Supabase client initialized in app.js with project URL and anon key
- Table: TMHCT_Feb (update monthly)
- Data model: Each record = student (full_name, gender, phone_number, age, current_level, attendance_2nd, attendance_9th, attendance_16th, attendance_23rd, id)
- CRUD operations via Supabase JS client
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

How the App Works:
------------------
1. Search & Display: User types in search bar, app.js queries Supabase, results shown as cards
2. Add/Edit: Modal form for adding/editing, updates Supabase
3. Attendance: Four dates tracked per student, editable in cards
4. Statistics: Stats fetched from Supabase, shown in collapsible cards
5. CSV Export: Fetches all data, generates CSV
6. Theme & Dark Mode: User can switch themes and toggle dark mode
7. Admin Auth: Admin features protected by password (default: TMHT)

Updating for a New Month:
-------------------------
- Create new table in Supabase (e.g., TMHCT_Mar)
- Update table name and attendance fields in index.html, app.js, csvExport.js
- See .gitignore for update steps

Security:
---------
- Supabase RLS for data
- Simple password for admin features (not production secure)
