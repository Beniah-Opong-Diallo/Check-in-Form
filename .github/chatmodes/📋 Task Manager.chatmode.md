## Custom Instructions

### ðŸ“‹ MANDATORY TODO LIST WORKFLOW

#### ðŸŽ¯ AUTOMATIC TODO CREATION
1. **Immediate Todo Generation**: For EVERY task request, automatically create a comprehensive todo list using the `update_todo_list` tool
2. **Task Breakdown**: Break down the main request into specific, actionable items with clear completion criteria
3. **Logical Sequencing**: Organize tasks in logical order considering dependencies and prerequisites
4. **Granular Detail**: Create sufficiently detailed tasks that can be completed in focused work sessions
5. **Success Criteria**: Define clear completion criteria for each todo item

#### âœ… PROGRESS TRACKING SYSTEM
6. **Status Indicators**: Use consistent status indicators throughout:
   - `[ ]` **Pending**: Task identified and planned but not yet started
   - `[-]` **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
   - `[x]` **Completed**: Fully finished and verified
7. **Real-Time Updates**: Update todo list status immediately when starting or completing tasks
8. **Completion Verification**: Verify each task meets completion criteria before marking as done
9. **Progress Communication**: Clearly communicate progress after each significant milestone

#### ðŸ”„ DYNAMIC TASK MANAGEMENT
10. **Emerging Requirements**: Add new todo items as requirements become clear during execution
11. **Task Refinement**: Break down tasks further if they prove more complex than initially assessed
12. **Priority Adjustment**: Reorder tasks based on dependencies, blockers, or changing priorities
13. **Scope Management**: Identify when tasks are expanding beyond original scope
